## Statistical Significance

| Test | Value | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| t-statistic | -6.5518 | Distance from null hypothesis |
| p-value | 0.000000 | ✅ Significant (α=0.05) |
| Cohen's d | -0.2072 | Small effect (below baseline) |
| 95% CI | [0.3245, 0.4074] | Baseline mean range |

### Statistical Conclusion

✅ **SIGNIFICANT**:
The metric's performance is statistically distinguishable from random at p < 0.05. This means there is less than a 5% probability that the observed results are due to chance.

---

## Cross-Validation (3-fold)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Mean Sharpe | 0.4058 | Average across folds |
| Std Sharpe | 0.3568 | Consistency measure |
| Stability | ✅ Stable positive performance (CV=0.88) | |

### Consistency Assessment

✅ **STABLE**:
Performance is consistent across different time periods (std < 0.5). This increases confidence in the metric's reliability.

---

## Recommendation

➡️ **MAINTAIN WEIGHT**: Metric performs at baseline level

### Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Status | Weight |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Statistical Significance | ✅ Pass | 40% |
| Effect Size > 0.2 | ✅ Pass | 30% |
| Cross-Validation Stable | ✅ Pass | 30% |
