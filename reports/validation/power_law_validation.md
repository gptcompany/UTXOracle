## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.0000 | Poor |
| Sortino Ratio | 0.0000 | Downside-adjusted returns |
| Max Drawdown | 0.00% | Peak-to-trough decline |
| Win Rate | 0.00% | Profitable trades |
| Profit Factor | 0.00 | Gross profit / Gross loss |

---

## Baseline Comparisons

| Baseline | Sharpe | Excess Return |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Random Baseline | 0.0000 | +0.0000 |
| Buy & Hold | 0.4323 | -0.4323 |

### Interpretation

- **vs Random**: Metric underperforms random signals by 0.0000 Sharpe
- **vs Buy & Hold**: Metric underperforms passive strategy by 0.4323 Sharpe

## Statistical Significance

| Test | Value | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| t-statistic | 0.0000 | Distance from null hypothesis |
| p-value | 1.000000 | ⚠️ Not significant (α=0.05) |
| Cohen's d | 0.0000 | Negligible effect (below baseline) |
| 95% CI | [0.0000, 0.0000] | Baseline mean range |

### Statistical Conclusion

⚠️ **NOT SIGNIFICANT**:
The metric's performance is NOT statistically distinguishable from random (p = 1.0000). This means the observed results could reasonably occur by chance.

---

## Cross-Validation (3-fold)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Mean Sharpe | 0.0000 | Average across folds |
| Std Sharpe | 0.0000 | Consistency measure |
| Stability | ✅ Stable zero performance | |

### Consistency Assessment

✅ **STABLE**:
Performance is consistent across different time periods (std < 0.5). This increases confidence in the metric's reliability.

---

## Recommendation

➡️ **MAINTAIN WEIGHT**: Metric performs at baseline level

### Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Status | Weight |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Statistical Significance | ⚠️ Fail | 40% |
| Effect Size > 0.2 | ❌ Fail | 30% |
| Cross-Validation Stable | ✅ Pass | 30% |
