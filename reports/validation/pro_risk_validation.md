## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Sharpe Ratio | -1.3550 | Poor |
| Sortino Ratio | -1.3955 | Downside-adjusted returns |
| Max Drawdown | 100.00% | Peak-to-trough decline |
| Win Rate | 48.73% | Profitable trades |
| Profit Factor | 0.60 | Gross profit / Gross loss |

## Baseline Comparisons

| Baseline | Sharpe | Excess Return |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Random Baseline | -1.3008 | -0.0543 |
| Buy & Hold | -1.3550 | +0.0000 |

## Statistical Significance

| Test | Value | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| t-statistic | -7.9768 | Distance from null hypothesis |
| p-value | 0.000000 | ✅ Significant (α=0.05) |
| Cohen's d | -0.2522 | Small effect (below baseline) |
| 95% CI | [-1.3136, -1.2866] | Baseline mean range |

### Statistical Conclusion

✅ **SIGNIFICANT**:
The metric's performance is statistically distinguishable from random at p < 0.05. This means there is less than a 5% probability that the observed results are due to chance.

---

## Cross-Validation (3-fold)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Mean Sharpe | -0.6648 | Average across folds |
| Std Sharpe | 1.8689 | Consistency measure |
| Stability | ⚠️ Unstable performance (CV=2.81) | |

### Consistency Assessment

⚠️ **UNSTABLE**:
Performance varies significantly across time periods (std = 1.8689). The metric may be regime-dependent or overfit to specific conditions.

---

## Recommendation

📉 **DECREASE WEIGHT**: Metric underperforms or is unstable

### Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Status | Weight |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Statistical Significance | ✅ Pass | 40% |
| Effect Size > 0.2 | ✅ Pass | 30% |
| Cross-Validation Stable | ⚠️ Fail | 30% |
