# Tasks: UTXOracle Live - Real-time Mempool Price Oracle

**Input**: Design documents from `/media/sam/1TB/UTXOracle/specs/002-mempool-live-oracle/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

**Tests**: Tests ARE REQUIRED per project constitution (TDD-first discipline)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `live/backend/` for Python modules
- **Frontend**: `live/frontend/` for JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- **Shared**: `live/shared/` for data models
- **Tests**: `tests/` at repository root

## Governance Note (2026-04-05)

- This spec captures the earlier mempool-live prototype line.
- The current production live direction is governed by `spec-040` and `spec-041`, with the canonical consumer surface on `:8011`.
- Remaining open tasks here should be read as legacy manual-validation, archival refactor, or optional parity backlog unless a concrete migration need reactivates them.
- This spec should not be treated as the default roadmap for the current live product surface.
- As of 2026-04-05, the remaining open tasks below are closed administratively so this dormant prototype does not continue to appear as active implementation debt.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - live price monitoring works end-to-end

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Visual Transaction Flow (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Visualize mempool transactions as scatter plot (timestamp vs price) with real-time updates

**Independent Test**: See live scatter plot with transaction dots appearing in real-time, mouseover shows details

### Tests for User Story 2 (TDD: Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

- [X] T074b [US2] Implement variable point size in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (scale based on tx USD value, 1-8px radius) ✅
- [X] T074c [US2] Implement fade-out in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (older points fade to 30% opacity over last 20% of time window) ✅
- [X] T074d [US2] Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: frontend manual verification is not maintained for this dormant prototype

### Bug Fixes (Critical for Visualization)

- [X] T074e [BUG] Fix DataStreamer analyzer reference (currently None, prevents transaction history from being sent to frontend) ✅
- [X] T074f [BUG] Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: superseded by the later baseline/live architecture
- [X] T074g [BUG] Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: historical note already says the path was observed working; no further dormant-spec action required

### Baseline + Live Architecture - OPTION B + Pragmatic Approach (APPROVED)

**Decision**: Copy algorithm from UTXOracle.py directly, skip parity tests for MVP
**Rationale**: UTXOracle.py rarely changes, verification tests can be added later if needed

**Phase BL-1: Baseline Calculator** (24h rolling window) 🎯 PRIORITY 1
- [X] T095 Create live/backend/baseline_calculator.py and copy Steps 7-11 from UTXOracle.py ✅ Core structure + stencils
- [X] T096 Implement 144-block rolling window (24h on-chain data storage) ✅ DONE (deque with maxlen=144)
- [X] T097 Implement calculate_baseline() → returns price + range + confidence ✅ DONE (Steps 7-11 algorithm with fallback)
- [X] T097a [BUG] Fix histogram population: Count transactions not sum amounts (commit 5bf19a1 line 232) ✅
- [X] T097b [BUG] Fix stencil slice length: 803 elements not 804 (commit 5bf19a1 line 294) ✅
- [X] T098 Add baseline state management (last_updated, block_height tracking) ✅ DONE (get_state)

**Phase BL-2: ZMQ Block Listener** (Continuous update trigger) 🎯 PRIORITY 2
- [X] T099 Add zmqpubrawblock subscription to live/backend/zmq_listener.py (dual sockets: tx + blocks) ✅
- [X] T100 Implement stream_blocks() async generator (yields raw block bytes + height) ✅
- [X] T101 Add block transaction parser (extract_transactions_from_block) ✅ live/backend/block_parser.py
- [X] T102 Integrate baseline recalculation on new block in orchestrator.py ✅ _process_blocks() task added

**Phase BL-3: Mempool Integration** (Use baseline) 🎯 PRIORITY 3
- [X] T103 Modify mempool_analyzer.py to accept baseline reference from orchestrator ✅
- [X] T103a [BUG] Fix orchestrator initialization: Pass initial baseline to analyzer (commit 3bcd828) ✅
- [X] T104 Update estimate_price() to use baseline price range for Y-axis scaling ✅
- [X] T105 Implement get_combined_history() returning baseline + mempool data points ✅
- [X] T106 Update WebSocketMessage in api.py to include baseline data (price, range) ✅

**Phase BL-4: Frontend Visualization** (Dual timeline) 🎯 PRIORITY 4
- [X] T107 Modify mempool-viz.js to render baseline points (cyan) vs mempool (orange)
- [X] T108 Add baseline price line indicator (horizontal reference line)
- [X] T109 Implement timeline split: LEFT=baseline (24h historical), RIGHT=mempool (3h real-time)
- [X] T110 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: manual prototype validation is superseded by the maintained live stack

**Phase BL-5: Code Refactoring** (Optional quality improvement) ⚠️ OPTIONAL
- [X] T111 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: optional prototype refactor no longer belongs to the active roadmap
- [X] T112 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: optional prototype refactor no longer belongs to the active roadmap
- [X] T113 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: optional prototype refactor no longer belongs to the active roadmap
- [X] T114 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: optional prototype refactor verification no longer belongs to the active roadmap

**Phase BL-6: Algorithm Verification** (Optional CI/CD) ⚠️ OPTIONAL - NOT PRIORITY
- [X] T115 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: parity-suite work is not pursued on the dormant prototype line
- [X] T116 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: parity test-vector generation is not pursued on the dormant prototype line
- [X] T117 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: parity reference wrapper is not pursued on the dormant prototype line
- [X] T118 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: dormant prototype does not carry active CI gating work

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - price display + scatter plot visualization

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Confidence Awareness (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Display confidence score (0.0-1.0) with visual warnings when estimate is unreliable

**Independent Test**: Price displays with confidence score, low confidence shows warning, color changes when confidence drops below 0.5

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD: Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

- [X] T075 [P] [US3] Write failing test for confidence calculation in tests/test_mempool_analyzer.py (test_confidence_score_ranges) ✅
- [X] T076 [P] [US3] Write failing test for low confidence warning in tests/integration/test_frontend.py (test_confidence_warning_display) ✅

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T077 [US3] Confidence calculation already implemented in T044 - verify it follows spec (0-100 tx: 0.0-0.3, 100-1000 tx: 0.3-0.8, 1000+ tx: 0.8-1.0) ✅
- [X] T078 [US3] Add confidence score display in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (show numeric score 0.0-1.0) ✅
- [X] T079 [US3] Implement color-coded warnings in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (green >0.8, yellow 0.5-0.8, orange <0.5) ✅
- [X] T080 [US3] Add "Low confidence - warming up" text warning in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (when confidence <0.5) ✅
- [X] T081 [US3] Update price display styling in live/frontend/styles.css (dynamic color based on confidence) ✅
- [X] T082 [US3] Verify T075-T076 tests now PASS (GREEN) ✅
- [X] T083 [US3] Manual test: Restart system, verify low confidence warning appears during warm-up, then disappears after 100+ transactions ✅ (documented in docs/MANUAL_TEST_US3_CONFIDENCE_WARNING.md)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories 1-3 should now be independently functional - price + visualization + confidence

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - System Health Visibility (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Display system statistics (total received/filtered/active transactions, uptime, connection status)

**Independent Test**: Dashboard shows stats, connection status indicator, numbers match Bitcoin Core mempool count ±5%

### Tests for User Story 4 (TDD: Write FIRST, ensure FAIL)

- [X] T084 [P] [US4] Write failing test for stats collection in tests/test_mempool_analyzer.py (test_get_stats_accuracy) ✅
- [X] T085 [P] [US4] Write failing test for stats display in tests/integration/test_frontend.py (test_stats_panel_rendering) ✅

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T086 [US4] Stats collection already implemented in T045 - verify get_state() returns all required fields ✅ MempoolState provides all stats
- [X] T087 [US4] Create stats panel UI in live/frontend/index.html (stats display area) ✅ Already exists (lines 31-48)
- [X] T088 [US4] Implement stats display in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (show "Received: X | Filtered: Y | Active: Z | Uptime: Xh Ym") ✅ updateStats() method
- [X] T089 [US4] Add uptime formatting in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (convert seconds to "Xh Ym" format) ✅ formatUptime() method
- [X] T090 [US4] Enhance connection status indicator in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (show "Disconnected" on ZMQ connection loss) ✅ Already implemented in US1
- [X] T091 [US4] Add auto-reconnect status in live/frontend/mempool-viz.js (show "Reconnecting..." during auto-retry) ✅ Already implemented in US1
- [X] T092 [US4] Verify T084-T085 tests now PASS (GREEN) ✅ Both tests passing
- [X] T093 [US4] Manual test: Compare "total received" vs Bitcoin Core mempool count (bitcoin-cli getmempoolinfo) - must match ±5% ⚠️ **BLOCKED: ZMQ not configured** (see docs/T093_validation_report.md)

**Checkpoint**: All 4 user stories implementation complete. Live validation blocked by missing Bitcoin Core ZMQ configuration (prerequisite). See quickstart.md Step 1.2 for ZMQ setup.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [X] T094 [P] Add performance optimization: Benchmark and optimize histogram binning (target: <100ms for 10k bins) ✅ DEFERRED - Performance already excellent (1.6M tx/sec), optimization not needed
- [X] T095 [P] Add error handling: Graceful degradation when Bitcoin Core disconnects ✅ Auto-reconnect logic in ZMQListener, try/except in orchestrator
- [X] T096 [P] Add logging enhancements: Structured JSON logs for all critical events (connection, price updates, errors) ✅ JSON logging configured in config.py
- [X] T097 [P] Write integration test for WebSocket load in tests/benchmark/test_websocket_load.py (100 concurrent clients) ✅ 2 tests passing (100 clients, disconnection handling)
- [X] T098 [P] Code cleanup: Run ruff format and ruff check --fix on all Python files ✅ All checks passing, 9 files formatted
- [X] T099 [P] Documentation: Update CLAUDE.md if file structure changed ✅ Status updated to reflect implementation complete
- [X] T100 [P] Documentation: Update README.md with quickstart instructions ✅ Added live system section with installation, systemd service
- [X] T101 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: quickstart revalidation is not required for the dormant prototype
- [X] T102 Create systemd service file (production deployment support) ✅ Service file + DEPLOYMENT.md created
- [X] T103 Security audit: Review for potential vulnerabilities (input validation, WebSocket connections) ✅ Comprehensive audit complete - NO CRITICAL ISSUES (see docs/T103_SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md + tests/test_security.py)
- [X] T104 Closed administratively on 2026-04-05: browser compatibility testing belongs to maintained surfaces, not this dormant prototype

Dormancy disposition (2026-04-05):

- Manual validation items were closed because the maintained live stack is now elsewhere.
- Optional refactor/parity tasks were closed because they no longer represent prioritized engineering work.
- Historical notes remain in place for traceability, but the spec no longer carries active implementation debt.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **US1 (Phase 3)**: Can start after Foundational - MUST complete before US2/US3/US4
  - **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 (needs pipeline working)
  - **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (needs confidence calculation)
  - **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 (needs stats collection)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Critical Path (Sequential)

1. Setup (T001-T010)
2. Foundational (T011-T019) ⚠️ BLOCKS everything
3. US1 Tests (T020-T027) → US1 Implementation (T028-T059) → US1 Validation (T060-T064) 🎯 MVP COMPLETE HERE
4. US2 Tests (T065-T066) → US2 Implementation (T067-T074)
5. US3 Tests (T075-T076) → US3 Implementation (T077-T083)
6. US4 Tests (T084-T085) → US4 Implementation (T086-T093)
7. Polish (T094-T104)

### Parallel Opportunities Within Phases

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T007, T008, T009 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T015, T016, T017, T018 can run in parallel after T011-T014

**Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**: T020-T027 all can run in parallel (write all failing tests together)

**Phase 3 (US1 Modules)**:
- Module 1 (T028-T032) and Module 2 (T033-T038) can run in parallel
- Module 3 internals: T039, T040, T041, T042 can run in parallel
- Module 5 files: T054, T055 can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T065-T066 can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T075-T076 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**: T084-T085 can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: T094-T100, T102-T104 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all US1 tests together (TDD: write all failing tests first):
Task T020: "Write failing test for ZMQ connection in tests/test_zmq_listener.py"
Task T021: "Write failing test for raw transaction yield in tests/test_zmq_listener.py"
Task T022: "Write failing test for transaction parsing in tests/test_tx_processor.py"
Task T023: "Write failing test for UTXOracle filters in tests/test_tx_processor.py"
Task T024: "Write failing test for histogram operations in tests/test_mempool_analyzer.py"
Task T025: "Write failing test for price estimation in tests/test_mempool_analyzer.py"
Task T026: "Write failing test for WebSocket streaming in tests/test_api.py"
Task T027: "Write failing integration test in tests/integration/test_pipeline.py"

# All 8 tests can be written in parallel by different agents/developers
# Then verify they ALL FAIL before starting implementation
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T010)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T011-T019) ⚠️ CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T020-T064)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. ✅ **MVP COMPLETE** - Deploy/demo real-time price monitoring

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T019) → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T020-T064) → Test independently → ✅ **Deploy/Demo MVP**
3. Add User Story 2 (T065-T074) → Test independently → ✅ **Deploy/Demo v1.1** (MVP + visualization)
4. Add User Story 3 (T075-T083) → Test independently → ✅ **Deploy/Demo v1.2** (+ confidence)
5. Add User Story 4 (T086-T093) → Test independently → ✅ **Deploy/Demo v1.3** (+ monitoring)
6. Polish (T094-T104) → ✅ **Deploy v2.0 Production Ready**

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers/agents:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T019)
2. **US1 must complete first** (T020-T064) - this is the foundation
3. Once US1 is done, can parallelize:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T065-T074)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (T075-T083)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (T086-T093)
4. Team completes Polish together (T094-T104)

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- **TDD enforced**: All tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group (use cleanup checklist from .github/CLEANUP_CHECKLIST.md)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Use pytest-watch (ptw --testmon --cov) for continuous testing during development
- Run ruff format/check before committing
